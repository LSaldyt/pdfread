# pdfread

## Description

A dopey python script that converts pdfs to text rather poorly.  
However, it is useful to me, and could be useful to someone else.  
Also, it is likely to get updated/used more in the future if it is useful to me... (no promises) 
So far, it is great for extracting emails from syllabi and similar pdf documents...   

Godspeed.  

## Requirements: 

`pip3 install --user PyPDF2`

## Usage:

`./pdfread test.pdf`
